Delivering high-quality software products requires a well-defined and disciplined **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**. In our day-to-day work, we leverage a rich set of tools that support every phase of the SDLC — from **planning** to **development**, **testing**, **deployment**, and **monitoring**.

This article presents a practical overview of how we **plan**, **build**, **test**, and **deliver** software using modern tools and agile methodologies.

---

## 1. Planning & Project Management

**Tools:** Jira, Agile, Scrum Ceremonies, PI Planning, Slack, Zoom, Google Meet, Gainsight

- We begin with **Agile** principles, including **PI Planning** to define quarterly goals and breakdown features.
- **Jira** helps manage epics, stories, tasks, and sprints.
- **Scrum ceremonies** like daily standups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives drive collaboration.
- Communication and updates happen via **Slack**, **Zoom**, **Google Meet**, and **Gainsight** for client/stakeholder insights.

## 2. Development Environment & Coding Tools

**Tools:** RubyMine, Cursor AI, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, ReactJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker

- **RubyMine** is our primary IDE for Ruby on Rails development.
- **Cursor AI** boosts productivity via AI-assisted code generation and navigation.
- We build frontends using **ReactJS** or **AngularJS**, powered by **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, and legacy **CoffeeScript**.
- Backend and full-stack applications run on **Ruby on Rails**.
- **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL** are used as per data structure needs (NoSQL vs relational).
- **Docker** ensures consistent development and testing environments across machines and teams.

---

## 3. Security & Accessibility

**Tools:** Snyk, Burp Suite, XSS Testing, Accessibility Guidelines, NVDA

- **Snyk** is used for automated dependency vulnerability scanning in code and containers.
- Manual security testing including **XSS** and other exploits is performed with **Burp Suite**.
- We ensure **accessibility** by adhering to WCAG standards and testing with screen readers like **NVDA**.

---

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

**Tools:** RSpec, Selenium, JMeter, Capybara

- **RSpec** is used for writing unit, integration, and model tests in Ruby.
- **Capybara** simulates user interaction for system and acceptance tests.
- **Selenium** performs cross-browser E2E testing.
- **JMeter** helps us conduct performance and load testing for APIs and services.

---

## 5. Continuous Integration & Deployment

**Tools:** Jenkins, Docker, Capistrano, AWS

- **Jenkins** runs our CI/CD pipelines — building, testing, and deploying code.
- **Docker** containers ensure clean builds across dev, staging, and production.
- **Capistrano** automates code deployment across environments.
- We host applications on **AWS**, using services like EC2, S3, RDS, ECS, and Lambda for scalable, reliable infrastructure.

---

## 6. Monitoring, Logging & Error Tracking

**Tools:** Logz.io, Airbrake, AWS CloudWatch, New Relic

- **Logz.io** offers centralized logging and alerting based on log patterns.
- **Airbrake** captures and reports runtime errors directly from production.
- **AWS CloudWatch** monitors EC2 instances, services, and logs.
- **New Relic** provides APM (Application Performance Monitoring) for tracing performance bottlenecks.

---

## 7. Continuous Improvement & Tech Health

**Tools & Practices:** Technical Debt Management, Upgrades, Retrospectives, Agile Sprints

- We continuously address **technical debt** as part of our sprint cycles.
- Framework and library **upgrades** are tracked and scheduled regularly.
- **Retrospectives** help us reflect on what's working and improve what’s not.
- Code reviews, documentation, and DevSecOps practices help maintain code quality and knowledge transfer.

## Final Thoughts

A modern SDLC blends process with automation, collaboration with tooling, and agility with stability. With the right tools in place, we ensure every feature we deliver is valuable, secure, tested, and scalable.
