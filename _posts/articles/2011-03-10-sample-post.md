If you ever used a MacBook then you know how pleasant and useful can be the trackpad gestures to change desktops. 
Unfortunately these gestures are not available by default on the major Linux distributions.

But thanks to Kohei Yamada who developed the application “Fusuma” in “Ruby” to recognise multi-touch input on the 
trackpad on Linux, shortcuts can be easily configured to different gestures.
